<h1>Elliptic Curve Cryptography</h1><br>
<p>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a type of public-key cryptography that is based on the mathematics of elliptic curves over finite fields. It provides a way to secure communications over an insecure channel by using pairs of public and private keys. The security of ECC is based on the difficulty of certain mathematical problems related to elliptic curves.</p>

<p>As part of our Information Security Flexible Internal Assessment, we delved into a comprehensive paper on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and successfully implemented the algorithm outlined in the study.</p>
